# C++ Exercise Repository

Welcome to the C++ Exercise Repository! This repository contains a collection of exercises designed to help you strengthen your understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP), the Standard Template Library (STL), and other fundamental concepts in C++.

## About

In this repository, you will find a variety of exercises that cover different aspects of C++ development. Whether you are a beginner looking to solidify your understanding of the basics or an experienced developer seeking to sharpen your skills, these exercises will provide you with valuable hands-on practice.

## Contents

The exercises are organized into various categories, allowing you to focus on specific areas of interest or tackle a comprehensive curriculum. Here are some of the key topics covered:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP): Explore the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism through a series of OOP exercises. Enhance your understanding of classes, objects, constructors, and member functions.

- Standard Template Library (STL): Dive into the powerful features of the STL, including containers like vectors, lists, and maps, as well as algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.

- Basics of C++: Brush up on the fundamentals with exercises that cover variables, control structures, loops, functions, and other essential concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a C++ development environment set up on your machine. If you don't have one already, you can install a compiler such as GCC or Clang, along with an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or Code::Blocks.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: "git clone git@github.com:AbdellahBellakrim/cpp42.git"

3.  Navigate to the cloned repository and explore the exercise categories that interest you the most. Each exercise is contained within its own directory and is accompanied by a detailed README file explaining the requirements and providing any necessary instructions.

4. Choose an exercise, open the corresponding directory, and start working on the provided code. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

5. Once you have completed an exercise, you can compare your solution with the provided sample solution in the repository. Take the time to analyze the sample solution and understand different approaches to problem-solving.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for other exercises in the repository, gradually building your skills and knowledge of C++.

Let's embark on this C++ learning journey together and strengthen our programming skills! Happy coding!
